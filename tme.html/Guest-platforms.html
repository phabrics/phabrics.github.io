<p>tmesh is meant to be an extensible platform, meaning that it should be
good enough to run any machine description coded according to its
standards. The standards have yet to be documented outside of the
source code. Right now, the only guest machines available are sun2,
sun3, sun4c, and sun4u (ultra-1). These work reasonably well right
now, but stability improvements are an ongoing affair. They are meant
for demonstration purposes alone, but will run relatively complete
emulations of certain configurations as documented on the original TME
site.
</p>
<p>Some guest operating systems have been tested as well. We will try to
document these as we test things out further. It is known that both
NetBSD &amp; OpenBSD (latest versions) are known to work pretty well on
all the guest machines. In addition, ethernet configuration has been
one of the major points of effort in this latest version of TME (the
other being upgrading from GTK+2 to GTK+3).
