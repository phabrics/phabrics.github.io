<p>TME is a generic machine emulation system for emulating one or more
machines. Each of the machines is specified in a special, extensible
machine description language (MDL) called tmesh. It includes an
interpreter for this language that is used to translate the
description into a working, dynamical system that emulates the
machine. The elements of the language are keywords that name
individual components of the machine. Each component is implemented
using dynamically loaded modules that are compiled directly into
native machine code. In this way, it is very similar to a virtual
machine and is what makes it so efficient compared to many other
systems which may interpret the individual component descriptions.
</p>
<p>The machine description itself is interpreted, but it creates a
statically connected system comprised of multiple dynamic modules that
are themselves compiled. As each component keyword is translated, the
components they describe get instantiated. This means that the
component module is dynamically loaded into the main running
program. In addition, components are connected via the &quot;at&quot;
keyword. When they are connected, a communications path is established
between the components. The path is dependent upon the interfaces
presented by the components. This means that the components must have
compatible interfaces in order to be connected using &quot;at&quot;. The
communications protocols are determined by the components as well, and
must obviously be compatible. In this way, the machine description
language is very close to how an actual technical specification might
be accomplished. This makes it a prime candidate for use in
prototyping systems as well as for distributing dynamic specifications
of production systems. It could also be a potential candidate for a
future board-level (or network-level) ESL system (like SystemC) that
actually compiles the MDL into an HDL such as Verilog or VHDL and from
there into actual hardware systems with associated software
toolchains. The possibilities are limitless!
</p>
<p>A good way to think of TME is that it is to machines what SPICE is to
circuits. In SPICE, the components can be standard, primitive devices
like resistors, diodes, and transistors, described using physical
constraints. They can be connected to form complex electronic circuits
which may then be simulated. Models of new components can be created
in the SPICE language to provide novel circuit elements. In the same
way, the elements in TME can be standard &quot;primitive&quot; components like
ICs, memories, busses, or external devices like NICs and disk
drives. New types of components can be modelled by coding their
behaviour directly in C source code which, when compiled, exports the
required interfaces as dynamically loaded modules using the extremely
portable GNU libltdl. They are combined to form more complex systems
such as computers that may then be emulated.
