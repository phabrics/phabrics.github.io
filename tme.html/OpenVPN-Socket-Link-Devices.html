<p>OpenVPN provides network links via sockets, for the purposes of creating
private networks over existing L3 networks, using IP protocols.  We
use this to expand ethernet networking capability with P2P links between
network elements of machines on different host machines or networks.  These
links are also known as tunnels because they can be used to make virtual
networks through physical networks.
</p>
<p>The usage is quite simple:  network elements are connected to link elements
in the same fashion as they are connected to other devices.  You can think
of them as virtual ethernet or TAP devices.  The link elements are paired
together, and can be in the same or other machine configurations to provide
a bridge for the ethernet traffic to flow between them.
</p>
<p>Link elements are paired by IP address.  They are implemented using sockets,
so they have a local and remote address.  The local address must be specified;
the remote may be specified or floating.  The encapsulating protocol may be
specified as UDP (stateless) or TCP (session-oriented).  In the latter case,
both machines must be running and connected for either to proceed.
</p>
<p>The sample machine configurations provide examples of different scenarios where
they might be used.  The simplest is a peer-to-peer connection between two
machines (or even two elements theoretically).  This demonstrates the extreme
flexibility of TME in specifying different network configurations over other
networks which might not have the needed resources or topology.  In particular,
TAP devices aren&rsquo;t available on every platform (ex: Cygwin).  You can bridge
between a platform that doesn&rsquo;t and one that does to give external network
access.  Once again, the possibilities are limited only by the firewalls.  You
can also use proxies to overcome this (not yet implemented, but coming soon),
or customize the firewall rules.
</p>
<p>Here is the peer-to-peer connection specification:
</p>
<p>Machine A -
<code>link0 at le0: tme/host/openvpn/socket/link --dev tap --local 192.168.0.1 --remote 192.168.0.2</code>
</p>
<p>Machine B -
<code>link1 at le0: tme/host/openvpn/socket/link --dev tap --local 192.168.0.2 --remote 192.168.0.1</code>
</p>
<p>This creates a network of two machines, but no external access.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a network description that allows for two remote machines, each on different hosts, to be connected to
two local machines, networked using the BPF/TAP combo, and connected externally via AutoNAT.
</p>
<p>Host 1:
Machine A -
<code>tap1: tme/host/tun/tap inet 10.0.77.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 bcast 10.0.77.255</code>
<code>link2 at tap1: tme/host/openvpn/socket/link --dev tap --local 192.168.0.1 --remote 192.168.0.2 --proto tcp-server</code>
<code>bpf1 at le0: tme/host/bsd/bpf interface tap0</code>
</p>
<p>Machine B -
<code>link3: tme/host/openvpn/socket/link --dev tap --local 192.168.0.1 --lport 1195 --remote 192.168.0.3</code>
<code>bpf1 at le0: tme/host/bsd/bpf interface tap0</code>
<code>bpf2 at link3: tme/host/bsd/bpf interface tap0</code>
</p>
<p>Host 2:
Machine B -
<code>link4 at le0: tme/host/openvpn/socket/link --dev tap --local 192.168.0.2 --remote 192.168.0.1 --proto tcp-client</code>
</p>
<p>Machine D -
<code>link5 at le0: tme/host/openvpn/socket/link --dev tap --local 192.168.0.3 --remote 192.168.0.1 1195</code>
</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, element names in the samples are unique, but the actual names of elements are unimportant,
so long as they are unique within a single machine configuration.  Also, when connecting more than one link,
different ports must be used (or the addresses must otherwise be unique, perhaps using different interfaces).
OpenVPN allows for shared ports, but it hasn&rsquo;t been tested yet.  The default protocol is UDP, but TCP can be
used as well, using the &ndash;proto argument to the openvpn element as shown above.
</p>
<p>As you can tell, this can get pretty complicated.  The following section is a discussion of the BPF/TAP
network bridge, for making a local network on the host.  The capabilities and documentation will continue
to improve, but TME is a great platform for experimentation.  Perhaps, there are other configurations
that have yet to be thought of... or better ways of accomplishing these tasks.  There are no correct methods,
but these idioms are a good starting point.
