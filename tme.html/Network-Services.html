<p>tmesh does not currently integrate any support services such as DHCP
or DNS. This must be done using external, third-party programs. For
instance, dnsmasq provides a pretty simple way to set up a DHCP/DNS
server by setting it up on the tap device or somewhere on the network
connected to which the machine(s) are connected. For example, you
could set it up on a tap master to provide these services to the
machines in the internal network. Another possibility is to run it on
a machine inside the network itself. dnsmasq is a good solution since
it is lightweight and aimed at embedded devices. You might also
consider using it for a netboot configuration using its BOOTP
capabilities. You can also use ISC&rsquo;s dhcpcd or mdnsd which are usually
included with BSD hosts. But for now, if you don&rsquo;t set these up, you
can still set up static configurations in your guests using ifconfig
to set up static ip addresses and route to set up routes. You can also
set up DNS statically using the hosts and resolv.conf files in the
guests. You can set up a static gateway/nat as described above using
tap. If you are using IPv6, then you can also set up router
advertisement to the TAP interface, using radvd (Linux), rtadvd (BSD),
or dnsmasq (portably). See docs for details...
