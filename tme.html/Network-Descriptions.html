<p>Using the tmesh machine description language, it&rsquo;s possible to
describe not only a single machine, but also an entire network of
machines. This is done by creating a clever configuration of TAP and
BPF network devices which allow multiple machines described by
different tmesh scripts to communicate. You can connect the machines
via their network devices using the very same statements that are used
to connect their other components. In particular, you create a
&quot;master&quot; machine that includes a tap connection that is then connected
to by other &quot;slave&quot; machines using bpf filters. The master&rsquo;s
connection can act as an application-level gateway by including a nat
configuration as well. You may then nat it to other subnets or to the
external network as described above. The slaves simply connect to the
tap device the same way they would to a real NIC. All slaves connected
in this way can directly communicate with each other or the master
machine using ethernet protocols. When configured correctly, they may
also communicate with the external machine or other networks outside
the internal network via nat.
</p>
<p>The naive approach is to create the master tap system the same way you
would any ordinary nat machine. In other words, the emulated NIC
connected directly to a tap device that may be nat&rsquo;d to an external
network. Other machines could then be added to the internal network
thus created, by using bpf to set a filter on the tap device. This
almost works. All the machines in the network can communicate with
each other. But only the master machine can communicate with the
external network. Why is this? The answer is that writing to the bpf
does not write back to the tap device. To communicate outside the
network, it is necessary to write to the tap. But remember that the
tap device is actually a software NIC that kind of works in reverse of
how the bpf devices do. Writing to tap sends packets to the
machine. Writing to bpf sends to the network. Reading is the opposite
in both cases, i.e., tap receives packets from the network, bpf
receives them from the machine. (It&rsquo;s actually a little more
complicated than that as bpf reads also read from the network, but
that&rsquo;s not an issue.) So, why is this a problem? Well, think about
what happens in the case where one of the bpf machines sends a packet
with a route through the tap device&rsquo;s address (i.e., a default,
gateway route). The tap will never see this packet! This is because
the write to bpf sent it &quot;out&quot; on the tap device&rsquo;s network, so tap
never saw it.
</p>
<p>Confusing, isn&rsquo;t it? How do we resolve this dilemma? The solution is a
little tricky, but it actually works out quite well. More importantly,
it works within the original methodology of TME, once again validating
its approach to describing complex systems through simple components
and working without requiring any updates to it. Plus, once you figure
it out, it&rsquo;s quite straightforward and provides a way to build up ever
more complex configurations from simple connections. You just have to
understand how the information flows between network components in
tmesh. Each network component is one side of a paired
connection. There is a read path and a write path and they are both
connected to the same other side. So when network components are
connected, a bidirectional path is set up between them, much like a
pipe. Writes to one end will be read from the other. This is why they
must be paired. As it turns out, this is all you need to set up just
about any network configuration. The key lies in how you set up the
master tap connection to the network. The sample tap machine
description simply paired the emulated NIC with the tap device. But,
this is not good enough. We also have to write back packets sent
through bpf filters set on the tap. As alluded to, this can already be
accomplished by setting up another pairing. Instead of pairing the tap
directly with the emulated NIC, we pair the tap with itself instead!
What this accomplishes is to make the packets written out to tap get
written back to the tap device, creating a loopback scenario. This
allows tap to see the packets written by
bpf. <a href="http://phabrics.com/MY-SUN4C3">Here</a> is a sample machine
description that establishes the writeback tap necessary to create a
fully nat&rsquo;ing network of machines! Note that it is a simple
modification of the standard sun4c description included with the
latest tme distribution. In particular, the relevant lines describing
this master configuration are changed to this:
</p>
<p><code> tap0:
tme/host/tun/tap interface tapA inet 10.0.77.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
bcast 10.0.77.255&nbsp;tap0 at tap0&nbsp;bpf0 at le0: tme/host/bsd/bpf
interface tapA&nbsp;</code>
</p>
<p>There are several things to note here. First, the tap device, tap0, is
no longer connected directly to the emulated NIC, le0. Instead, it is
now a root node. Second, you may see duplicate ICMP packets when doing
pings. This is not because of suboptimal routing, but because the bpf
device detects both reads and writes of packets to the tap
device. Since all the packets are written back, they are all
duplicated. This is inefficient, since only packets destined for tap
need be written back. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no way around this in the
current version of TME, because we can&rsquo;t yet set a filter on tap
devices directly. Future revisions should fix this issue. Finally, the
first two lines are unique to this master configuration. The last line
is shared among all the slave configurations as well as this one. The
bpf filter is set on the tap device by naming its interface the same
as tap0&rsquo;s. It is paired with the emulated NIC (le0), effectively
connecting the each slave machine to the tap network.
</p>
<p>Note: The sample master config was for Linux. The interface name in
particular might need to be changed depending on whether the platform
supports that or not. In NetBSD, for instance, the default names start
at tap0 and go up from there.
</p>
<p>Note: The different machines should run in their own processes in
order to be efficient. When looked at this way, the ethernet trunk is
analogous to an IPC bus connecting the processes. Indeed, it might
make a nice alternate mechanism for just such a purpose. The tap/bpf
devices each run in a separate &quot;thread&quot; within each process, just like
all the other components. The more components, the more threads
needed; currently the threading model is cooperative using a coprocess
technique that does not take full advantage of the multithreading
capabilities of modern processors. This is one area for future
improvement.
